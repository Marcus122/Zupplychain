								<li><span class="bold">HOW THE CONTRACTS ARE FORMED BETWEEN YOU, US AND THE REGISTERED STORAGE PROVIDER AND BETWEEN YOU AND THE REGISTERED STORAGE PROVIDER</span>
									<ol>
										<li>Our web pages will guide you through the steps you need to take to place an order with the Registered Storage Provider. Our site order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your order to the Registered Storage Provider through our site for the Services. Please take the time to read and check your order at each page of the order process. You acknowledge that we do not provide the Services and have no responsibility or liability for them.</li>
										<li>After you place an order incorporating the Contracts, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that your order has been received by our Site and that it has been forwarded to the relevant Registered Storage Provider.  However, please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted.  Acceptance of your order will take place as described in clause 6.3. In particular please note that any quotation or indication as to price given or date availability at any particular location by us or the Registered Storage Provider shall not constitute an offer and may be changed prior to Confirmation. If the dates you have specified are unavailable the Registered Storage Provider may then notify you of the next best dates  together with the price for those dates and request you to confirm that your order is to be altered to those dates and to confirm your offer at the new price and with new dates. If your requirements, in the Registered Storage Provider’s opinion, necessitate changes to the <span class="italics">Terms and conditions of supply of services by registered storage provider to customer</span>, Supplementary Terms may be notified to you by or on behalf of the Registered Storage Provider for acceptance as part of the process to conclude the Contracts and you will be asked to confirm your offer incorporating the Contracts as varied or supplemented by the Supplementary Terms.</li>
                                        <li>The Registered Storage Provider will confirm acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail through our site (<span class="bold">Confirmation</span>). The Contracts between us, you and the Registered Storage Provider in these Terms and between the Registered Storage Provider and you in the terms of the <span class="italics">Terms and conditions of supply of services by registered storage provider to customer</span>, as varied or supplemented by the Supplemental Terms (if any) will only be formed when the Registered Storage Provider sends you the Confirmation. The Confirmation will set out details of the Registered Storage Provider with whom you have contracted.</li>
                                        <li>If following the issue of a Confirmation the Registered Storage Provider is unable to supply you with a particular Service, for example because that Service is no longer available or because the Registered Storage Provider cannot meet your requested dates in the location requested or because of an error in the price on our site as referred to in clause 10.2, we or the Registered Storage Provider will inform you of this by e-mail and your order will not processed and any Contracts concluded will be cancelled and in respect thereof (save in respect of monies paid to the Registered Storage Provider) no party shall have any claim against any other. If you have already paid the Registered Storage Provider for the Service, the Registered Storage Provider will refund you the full amount charged as soon as possible.

                                        <li>If we and/or the Registered Storage Provider have to revise these Terms and/or the <span class="italics">Terms and conditions of supply of services by registered storage provider to customer</span> as they apply to your order after issue of the Confirmation and such revisions materially and adversely affect you, we and/or the Registered Storage Provider will contact you to give you reasonable advance notice of the changes and let you know how to cancel the Contracts if you are not happy with the changes.

The easiest way to do this is to complete the cancellation form on our website. If you use this method we will e-mail you or the Registered Storage Provider (as the case may be) to confirm we have received your or the Registered Storage Provider’s (as the case may be) cancellation and forward the notice of cancellation to the Registered Storage Provider or you (as the case may be).<br/><br/>
                                        You or the Registered Storage Provider can also e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@zupplychain.com">info@zupplychain.com</a> or contact our Customer Services team by telephone on 0161 705 4326 or by post to Zupplychain Ltd, Imperial House, 79-81 Hornby Street, Bury, BL9 5BN. If you or the Registered Storage Provider is e-mailing us or writing to us please include details of the order to help us to identify it. If you or the Registered Storage Provider send us your cancellation notice by e-mail or by post, then, provided such cancellation is received by us no later than 28 calendar days prior to the first date on which the Services are to be commenced pursuant to the Contracts, cancellation with no payment in respect of such cancellation is effective from the date we receive it. (Or, if we receive it outside normal working hours) the next working day after we receive it.</li>
                                        <li>If you cancel the Contracts after the date 28 calendar days prior to the first date on which the Services are to be commenced pursuant to the Contracts you agree that you shall pay to the Registered Storage Provider in respect of such cancellation on demand an amount equal to the amount that would have been due under the contracts for the first calendar week of such Contracts if they had been performed in full as envisaged in the Confirmation as liquidated damages. The parties confirm that this sum represents a genuine pre-estimate of the Registered Storage Provider's loss in respect of such cancellation.</li>
                                        <li>On cancellation the Registered Storage Provider will arrange a full refund of any price you have paid (subject to a deduction for amounts owed by you to the Registered Storage Provider) whether by way of liquidated damages or otherwise as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days after you or the Registered Storage Provider inform us of your or the Registered Storage Provider’s decision to cancel the Contracts.

If we discover an error in the price of the Services you have ordered where a Confirmation has been given we or the Registered Storage Provider will contact you through our Site to inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Services at the correct price or cancelling your order. If we or the Registered Storage Provider are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the Contracts as cancelled and notify you in writing and in respect thereof no party shall have any claim against any other. Please note that if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, the Registered Storage Provider does not have to provide the Services to you at the incorrect (lower) price.</li>
